When we draw a line segment between two randomly chosen points on the perimeter of the disk, it will intersect all the previously drawn line segments. The number of regions created by the line segments in a disk is related to the number of intersections of these line segments.\n\nFor a disk divided by \\( n \\) line segments, the maximum number of regions \\( R(n) \\) that can be formed is given by the formula:\n\\[ R(n) = n + 1 + \\text{number of intersections} \\]\n\nHowever, since we are asked for the expected number of regions, we need to consider the average number of intersections per new line segment added. Each new line segment will intersect all the previous \\( n \\) line segments. If there are \\( n \\) line segments already drawn, each new line segment will intersect each of the existing \\( n \\) line segments. Therefore, each new line segment will intersect \\( n \\) times, but we have to avoid double-counting the intersections.\n\nThe expected number of regions formed by \\( n \\) line segments in a disk is not straightforward to compute directly without simulation or a more complex combinatorial argument. However, we can use a known result from geometric probability theory for this type of problem.\n\nFor a disk divided by \\( n \\) line segments, the expected number of regions \\( E(R(n)) \\) is approximately \\( 2n + 1 \\). This result comes from the fact that each new line segment intersects all the previous ones, creating an additional region for each intersection plus one more.\n\nGiven that we start with 4 quadrants and draw 27 line segments (including the original 4), the expected number of regions can be approximated using the formula above. Let's calculate it using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\nWe'll simulate the process to find the expected number of regions.
